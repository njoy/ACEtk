    "In this example, we will create a dosimetry ACE file (also known as a type 'y' file) for a single nuclide using only ENDFtk and ACEtk. The dosimetry ACE file is a very simple ACE file containing a list of reaction numbers and associated cross section data sets. Contrary to the continuous energy table upon which it is based, the dosimetry file cross section data is not given on a unionised grid and the energy grid of each cross section stored in the file may be different.\n",
